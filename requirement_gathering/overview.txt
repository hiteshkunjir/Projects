Project Overview
The goal is to create a data warehouse that aggregates and analyzes stock market data from various sources, enabling traders and analysts to gain insights into market trends.

Step 1: Define Requirements
Data Sources: Identify APIs to pull stock market data (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance).
Data to Extract:
Historical stock prices (open, close, high, low, volume).
Company details (name, sector, market cap).
Economic indicators (if applicable).
Step 2: Set Up Your Environment
Database: Choose a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle).
Tools: Use SQL for ETL, and consider tools like Python for API interactions and data extraction.
Step 3: Design the Data Warehouse Schema
Fact Tables:
Stock_Prices_Fact:
stock_id: Foreign key to dimension table.
date: DATE.
open_price: DECIMAL.
close_price: DECIMAL.
high_price: DECIMAL.
low_price: DECIMAL.
volume: INT.
Dimension Tables:
Stocks_Dim:
stock_id: Primary key.
symbol: VARCHAR.
company_name: VARCHAR.
sector: VARCHAR.
market_cap: DECIMAL.
Date_Dim:
date_id: Primary key.
date: DATE.
year: INT.
month: INT.
quarter: INT.
Step 4: Extract Data
Use API calls to extract stock data. For example, using Python with the requests library:
python
Copy code
import requests
import pandas as pd

api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
symbol = 'AAPL'
url = f'https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_DAILY&symbol={symbol}&apikey={api_key}&outputsize=full'

response = requests.get(url)
data = response.json()

# Convert to DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data['Time Series (Daily)']).T
df.columns = ['open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume']
df.reset_index(inplace=True)
df.rename(columns={'index': 'date'}, inplace=True)
Step 5: Transform Data
Clean and format the data for loading.
Ensure data types match the target schema.
Perform any necessary calculations, such as moving averages.
Step 6: Load Data
Use SQL INSERT statements or bulk loading methods to populate your fact and dimension tables.
sql
Copy code
-- Example: Load stock prices
INSERT INTO Stock_Prices_Fact (stock_id, date, open_price, close_price, high_price, low_price, volume)
VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?);
Step 7: Create Views and Reports
Create SQL views for common queries, like average closing prices or daily price changes.
sql
Copy code
CREATE VIEW Avg_Close_Prices AS
SELECT s.company_name, AVG(sp.close_price) AS avg_close
FROM Stock_Prices_Fact sp
JOIN Stocks_Dim s ON sp.stock_id = s.stock_id
GROUP BY s.company_name;
Step 8: Schedule Data Updates
Use cron jobs or database scheduling features to regularly update your data warehouse with new stock data.
Step 9: Validate and Test
Ensure data integrity and accuracy by comparing your loaded data with source data.
Run tests on your views and reports to validate that they return expected results.
Step 10: Documentation
Document your ETL process, data models, and any business logic applied during transformation for future reference.
Conclusion
This project will not only enhance your ETL skills but also give you valuable insights into stock market trends and analysis. If you need help with any specific steps, feel free to ask!
